                        <p> Hello. My name is Mehmet. I born in 1993 in Antalya. I have been playing games since... well I dont remember actually. I have 
                        childhood images that I am playing some DOS games but I don't remember when it started.</p>

                        <p>It really sounds cool when someone say " I started programming when I was 14 ". I did actually but it was really amateur attempts and I can not say it made me good programmer. 
                         What making me better programmer than previous day are, a good background of math and physics, and being satisfied by self-improvement instead of wasting my time (even by playing games). I learn programming from my university but I did not wait them teach. I improved my programming by working with outside class projects, teaching friends what I learned and pair programming with experience programmers. Also I finished many courses in Udemy. </p>

I belive in myself and take serious from the first they I want (it was about highschool times). And every day I get close I increase my motivation and performance to be a part of it. </p>

In a single day at my first year in college I deleted all the games in my computer and setup Linux to learn Data Structers with C language at that time. Now I am playing 1-3 hours mostly at weekends. </p>
